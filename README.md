### How to Run
This app is employed using node in the terminal. To run this program: download files, open terminal and navigate to the downloaded folder. Once inside the folder, type the following command into the terminal to begin:
`node index.js`

Use arrow keys to make your first selection (to play or to exit). By selecting play, blanks will be printed to the screen and you'll be prompted to enter a letter.  If you guess the correctly, the letter will appear. If you do not guess correctly, you have a few more chances to guess correctly.  To win, guess the word before your guesses run out.  If you lose, you will be prompted to play again or exit.
